The Exception MessageBox is a custom gui MessageBox specifically designed to display the details
of an Exception object to the user for debugging purposes.  This project was inspired by the
[ExceptionMessageBox](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.sqlserver.messagebox.exceptionmessagebox?view=sqlserver-2016)
class that is bundled with the Microsoft Sql Server Management Studio application.

This project will be divided into multiple parts based on the dotnet gui framework. The gui
frameworks that are currently available are:

* WPF

There are plans to add gui support for the following frameworks:

* Windows Forms
* Avalonia

If there are other framworks, please let me know.
